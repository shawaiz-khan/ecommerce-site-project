                    <p class="lead">
                        EcoMart started with a simple idea: to create a place where people can find eco-friendly options
                        for everyday life. We wanted to make it easier for anyone to make choices that help the planet.
                        Over time, what began as a small dream has grown into a community of people who share our values
                        and vision for a better world.
